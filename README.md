# Home-Depot-Product-Search-Relevance

Problem Description:
You will implement a program to obtain the required results in this contest on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-depot-product-search-relevance. You are required to build a program using the provided train.csv, product_descriptions.csv & attributes.csv and determine the search term relevance for all the instances in the provided test.csv. (The terminology of “training” and “test” here is from Kaggle’s viewpoint, in that they can use test.csv to evaluate your algorithm results, since they know the ratings for instances in test.csv. However, in developing and evaluating your method, you would need to consider train.csv as given data and partition it into training and test sets
